# Project Readme
This is intended to be a web browser-based interface that both stores relevant game data for walkthru purposes & also keeps track of the user's progress in a particular playthru. Filling in the gaps in information that the game does not show the player, in some sense. For example, under the Awards tab on the inventory screen, a player can see how many taverns they've won an Arcomage game at, but not which taverns are left, which can make for a long process of completing the Arcomage quest if you forget which one of the 11 (Jadame) or 13 (Antagarich) taverns is left!

The actual design specs of the project will be written up in a file named ProjectDesign.md at a later date. This readme will be updated infrequently, but as needed.
